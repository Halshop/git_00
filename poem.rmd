<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

WITH saddest music all day long  
She soothed her secret sorrow:  
At night she sighed "I fear 'twas wrong  
Such cheerful words to borrow.  
Dearest, a sweeter, sadder song  
I'll sing to thee to-morrow."  
  

<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->

I thanked her, but I could not say  
That I was glad to hear it:  
I left the house at break of day,  
And did not venture near it  
Till time, I hoped, had worn away  
Her grief, for nought could cheer it!
